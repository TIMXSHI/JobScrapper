At Cosive, we’re a fully remote specialist consultancy in cyber threat intelligence and security operations.

What we offer:

A flexible, fully-remote company (anywhere in AU/NZ)

Senior Security Consultant Job Duties

Senior Security Consultants at Cosive are hands-on technical specialists in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and/or security operations (SecOps). They are responsible for delivering high-quality outcomes for clients by applying deep technical expertise, structured methodologies, and practical problem-solving. This role is delivery-focused: Senior Security Consultants perform the bulk of the technical consulting work for clients, while also providing strategic insight where required.

Senior Security Consultants are responsible for working closely with clients to discern what goals they wish to achieve and then delivering to help them achieve those goals. This requires an ability to build close relationships with our clients and to listen to and understand their situation and needs, as well as having strong technical skills and strategic insights. The ideal candidate is someone who has strong cyber security experience, knows how to ask good questions of a client, analyse their problem, turn that into a plan, get feedback, and execute on that plan either themselves or with others in Cosive.

Our ideal candidate will be adept at engaging with stakeholders at all levels, both internally and externally. Internal engagement will be collaborating with other Cosive staff or board members in tactical, operational and strategic conversations. External engagement can be both at the CISO level as well as working with deep technical experts such as SOC analysts and CTI analysts to add value to their operations.  External networks and engagement skills are also important with peers and industry to demonstrate thought leadership and support to the wider industry. 

While not typical, there may occasionally be a requirement to attend client sites to perform work, primarily in Australia and New Zealand. Similarly, there may infrequently be a need to attend company meetings at locations chosen by Cosive. There may be opportunities to attend security conferences within Australasia and internationally. 

Senior Security Consultants may help deliver technical demonstrations and/or technical scoping discussions with clients or potential clients.  

Work hours are typically Australian or New Zealand office hours of 9am-5pm, with flexible working hours available if requested. Please note, you may be required to start early or work late in order to attend a video conference involving someone from another time zone and we expect our staff to accommodate that requirement where possible.

Important: Only Australian or New Zealand residents will be accepted for this role, and the successful candidate must undergo a police check before the position will be offered to them.

About Cosive

What we do

Cosive is a specialist consultancy for cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and security operations (SecOps). We offer cybersecurity consultancy services, perform custom software development, run training courses, resell some select products, and notably we develop our own software service offerings: CloudMISP, MalwareZoo and Antifraud. We have a strong software development and engineering capability underpinning our SecOps and CTI services.

Our approach

We operate as a specialist trusted partner with our clients, working together to help them improve their security posture over time. We build close relationships with our clients and often work with them over multiple engagements over multiple years. Honesty, integrity, and trust are core values of our business.

We are a fully virtual company, with all staff working remotely from home or a co-working space if preferred. We are primarily based in Australia and New Zealand. All communications are carried out via chat room, email, and videoconferencing.

We often deal with international overseas companies. This fact means that occasionally you may be required to start early or work late in order to attend a meeting involving someone from another timezone. This is one of the reasons we have a flexible working hours policy for staff to enable them to build their work schedule around their own lifestyle. Domestic and international travel may occasionally be required to support our customers or attend conferences.

Cosive’s value stems from our people and their talent. We have a staff-first approach to workloads and the engagements we take on and we respect that each of the members of our team are experienced, capable professionals with a life outside of work. We don’t clock-watch or micromanage our team; we rely on everyone’s ability to work autonomously and collaborate when necessary to achieve good outcomes. We expect staff to be proactive and self-driven, and to always be looking for ways to contribute positively to our team.

We want you to gain as much from working at Cosive as Cosive gains from your skills, so we provide staff training opportunities, both internal and external, to ensure that your skills stay relevant and that you can eventually take that next step in your career.

We care about our staff's wellbeing. We know the impact that the stress of intensive work can have on people. This is why for the last few years, we've been giving each staff member an extra day of leave each month to use for their mental health in addition to their annual leave. We call this the Cosive ME day. Please note the Cosive ME day is an additional gift provided by Cosive and is discretionary, and does not form part of your standard remuneration package.
