The Principal role is a senior position within the team. We operate by running ‘projects’ across the above areas of responsibility, and our emphasis changes through the year depending on the needs of the business.

Lead investment management activities, including target scanning, prospect analysis, value driver mapping, valuation forecasting, scenario planning and business case development, portfolio relationship management and review, and transaction process scoping and oversight.
Design and deliver key elements of SEEK’s investment portfolio management, corporate planning and communications – taking full delivery responsibility where appropriate.
Write and present crisp, compelling materials for executive, board-level and external audiences.
Qualifications

The successful candidate will have:

Multi-year experience working in strategy-related roles, with more than one year at engagement manager level or above in a top-tier strategy consulting firm, or equivalent top tier PE/investment banking firm or technology leader industry experience.

Highly developed analytical and problem-solving skills with proven ability to break down complex strategic problems through hypothesis-driven analysis.
Experience leading work streams autonomously, including taking responsibility for team deliverables and managing teams of analysts or subject matter experts.
Strong executive communication skills, including developing Board-level materials and presenting to senior leadership.
Versatility to alternate between strategic leadership and detailed analysis as projects require.

Direct experience working on M&A transactions or similar corporate development activities (including thesis, valuation and due diligence), and demonstrated understanding of the end-to-end process.

Strong quantitative analysis capabilities, particularly in financial modelling and valuation.
Experience with transaction due diligence across commercial, financial, and operational workstreams. Strong preference for people with experience on multiple transactions.
Ability to assess strategic fit, synergies and identify integration opportunities and challenges.
Understanding of deal execution processes and stakeholder management in transaction contexts.

Strategic thinking with business acumen and collaborative execution.

Track record of solving ambiguous strategic problems (where to play, how to win) with fact-based approaches.
Demonstrated ability to establish relationships and influence senior stakeholders across diverse functions.
Comfort with ambiguity and data-driven experimentation in fast-changing environments.
Passion for technology and marketplace businesses, with intellectual curiosity and a high learning orientation.
