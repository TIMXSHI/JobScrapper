Do you thrive on uncovering opportunities hidden in numbers and influencing strategy at the highest level?

Adore Beauty is searching for a Senior Marketing Analyst to play a critical role in shaping the future of our customer growth, loyalty, and acquisition strategy. This is a senior role where your insights will directly influence decision-making, guide multi-million-dollar marketing investments, and elevate the performance of our much-loved Adore Rewards program.

This is more than a reporting role. We're looking for someone who can see the bigger picture — an analyst who combines technical excellence with strategic vision, and who has the confidence to step into the room with senior leaders and influence the path forward.

About the Role
As Senior Marketing Analyst, you'll partner closely with the Head of Acquisition & Loyalty and work alongside Marketing and Data leaders to translate complex information into clear, actionable recommendations. You'll dive deep into loyalty, acquisition, and eCommerce data, applying predictive analytics, advanced modelling, and commercial acumen to drive measurable outcomes.

A typical week might see you building intuitive dashboards that become the go-to decision-making tool for executives, conducting deep-dive analysis on customer behaviour to uncover new opportunities, forecasting campaign performance to advise where to invest, acting as the bridge between marketing and data teams to ensure alignment, and meeting with external partners (e.g. Mutinex, Emarsys, Supermetrics) to optimise our data ecosystem.

You'll have the freedom to explore ideas, challenge assumptions, and test new ways of working — with the backing of a company that values curiosity, collaboration, and doing the right thing.

Key Responsibilities:

Deliver advanced insights into loyalty, acquisition, and eCommerce that inform strategy and drive growth.
Own and evolve the marketing reporting suite, providing clear and engaging visualisations for daily performance through to board-level summaries.
Translate technical analysis into commercial outcomes, influencing decisions across marketing, digital, and executive leadership teams.
Apply predictive and advanced analytics to model customer behaviour, forecast campaign results, and guide investment decisions.
Build trusted relationships across marketing, data, and external analytics partners to continually improve our capability.
Identify opportunities to strengthen and expand the Adore Rewards program, increasing engagement, satisfaction, and customer lifetime value.
Champion a culture of data-led decision-making within the marketing team and across the wider business.
Who You Are:
You are more than a data expert, you are a strategic thinker who can see both the detail and the bigger picture. You balance technical excellence with commercial acumen, and you know how to use insights to tell a story that inspires change.

You thrive in fast-paced, evolving environments and have the confidence to influence senior stakeholders. Collaboration comes naturally to you, and you enjoy working at the intersection of marketing, data, and customer strategy.

You bring:

Proven experience in data and analytics, ideally within retail or eCommerce.
A track record of influencing marketing and customer strategies through insights.
Advanced capability in data visualisation tools (Tableau or similar) and Google Analytics 4.
Strong skills in forecasting, predictive modelling, and customer behaviour analysis.
Excellent communication and storytelling skills, with the ability to present complex insights simply.
Experience working across loyalty, acquisition, and eCommerce is highly desirable.
Bonus skills that will set you apart: MMM, Supermetrics, AWS, SQL.
