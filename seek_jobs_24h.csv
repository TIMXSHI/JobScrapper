Collaborate with stakeholders to understand business needs and translate them into AI-powered solutions.
You will be a key decision-maker and technical expert in evaluating the risk, return, and strategic fit of AI initiatives, with the authority to recommend build, buy, or defer pathways based on clear criteria.

Machine Learning Model Development:
Develop and implement machine learning models to analyse large datasets, predict outcomes, and optimize business processes.
Apply natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and other AI techniques to solve domain-specific challenges.
Data Management and Integration:
Design tools that extract, transform, and process structured and unstructured data (PDFs, slides, and more).
Work with large, complex datasets from diverse sources, ensuring data quality and integrity.
Integrate AI solutions with existing systems and databases to enable seamless data flow and real-time decision-making.
Collaboration and Innovation:
Partner with scientists, researchers, and business teams to identify AI opportunities and drive innovation.

Privacy and trust are foundational — not afterthoughts.

Team Collaboration & Developer Mentorship
You will work across functions — and lead from the front.

Quality Control, Experiment Discipline & Result Reproducibility
Experimentation is encouraged — but always under discipline

You will be considered successful in this role not by the number of models shipped — but by:

Your judgment and decision-making on when to build, test, or integrate AI capabilities.
The integrity, scalability, and impact of the AI systems you help deploy.
Your ability to keep us aware of — and ahead of — meaningful developments in the AI space.
The security, privacy, and legal soundness of every AI workflow under your guidance.

About the role

This is not a SEO marketing role. 

The Programmatic SEO (PSEO) Product Manager will lead product strategy and delivery for our programmatic SEO Insights Service – a system designed to drive scalable growth through automation, advanced insights, and experimentation. This includes shaping capabilities for large-scale content and page generation, discovery of high-value opportunities, and enabling global expansion at speed - across 40+ languages.

Lead programmatic SEO strategy and execution for some of Canva’s most important logged-out growth surfaces, ensuring these areas continue to scale sustainably and drive measurable impact.

Accelerate large-scale page launches and identify opportunities to expand into new high-value markets, topics, and content categories.

Scale and prioritise automation systems that power programmatic SEO, enabling smaller organic growth teams to achieve disproportionately large results.

Collaborate closely across functions including SEO, engineering, content, platform infrastructure, marketplace, and product surface teams to deliver aligned, high-quality outputs.

Advance AI-driven content workflows to improve efficiency, quality, and experimentation velocity in programmatic SEO.

Strengthen international growth capabilities by ensuring automation systems can support localisation and market-specific needs at scale.

You're probably a match if

You’re a Senior Product Manager with experience in infra, ML platforms, and with a strong systems-level thinking.

You have deep curiosity about experimentation, automation, and search trends.

You don’t need to be an SEO expert – we have that covered – but must know how to lead complex workflows across Machine Learning/Engineering/SEO/Content.

You are analytical and love diving into data (Bonus: familiarity with SEO tools and platforms)

You thrive on collaborating with cross-functional and international stakeholders

You have prior experience in process mapping and optimization

You have a persistent desire to leverage automation and machine learning to do things more efficiently

You have a growth mindset and value detail as much as the big picture. You thrive in a collaborative fast-paced environment, working together with a diverse set of stakeholders from SEO to Design, Marketing and Engineering, to figure out how we can multiply the impact of every organic growth strategy across surfaces and end to end user funnels. 

You consider yourself a strong all-rounder; data, research, strategy, product mock-ups - whatever it's, you can comfortably wear the hat

The mission of Product Managers at Canva is to create the most accessible design tool for every person in the world. We believe that we can improve the world by empowering everyone to design and communicate visually. As a Product Manager at Canva you help set this vision, define what that future looks like, and build the products that get us there.

Product Managers collaborate with Canva’s founders to set the strategic direction, scope, and success metrics for product initiatives. We work across teams of designers, software engineers, marketers and analysts to ensure we're delivering an exceptional experience to all our users. We are responsible for implementing and collaborating on product strategy, roadmapping, and prioritisation as our product grows. It’s our responsibility to see products through their entire lifecycle—from concept through to validation, build, post-launch analytics and iterations.
