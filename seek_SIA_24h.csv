TinyThunder is a finance-led transformation partner for complex, growth-minded businesses. We help companies sharpen decision-making, maximise resources, and lift financial outcomes – while building capability across the organisation, not just within finance. We step in when internal capacity is stretched, and results need to land fast – bringing clarity, alignment, and commercial impact. Our motto: Built for outcomes. Designed to fit.

TinyThunder forms the Corporate Advisory pillar of a broader group of companies under the XEY Ventures umbrella.


The role:

You’ll step in as a Finance Transformation Lead, driving execution across client programs. With us, it’s not just about analysing – it’s about landing outcomes.

In practice, that means:

Driving the delivery of complex, strategically significant finance transformation projects from initiation to execution.

Running structured working sessions with client teams to align owners, surface issues, and lock in delivery plans.

Helping clients navigate trade-offs and sequence initiatives to build momentum, not noise.

Turning raw, messy data into clear insights that executives can act on – and then making sure those actions actually happen.

Cutting through system complexity to build a finance stack that scales, controls, and works in practice.

Keeping the scoreboard honest: tracking delivery to the P&L and cash flow, not just a PowerPoint slide.

Making finance accountable for outcomes, not just numbers.

Operating in person with clients (mainly metro Melbourne) alongside our team in Cremorne, where pace, clarity, and results matter most.

This is an execution-first environment. You’ll be in the arena with owners, CFO’s, leadership teams and operators who expect sharp thinking, straight talk, and real results.


Who you are:

You are ambitious with a bias for action and a competitive edge; you like winning more than talking about winning.

You are an Excel lover at heart (advanced modelling, scenario analysis, structured problem‑solving) and a PowerPoint storyteller who can earn buy‑in.

Have a Big 4 or consulting background (audit, transaction services, consulting) and/or you’re in industry as a Finance Manager / Finance Business Partner / Commercial lead in a large multinational.

You dig into complex data, challenge it with stakeholders, and get to the truth.

You are an executor – you close loops, land outcomes, and keep high standards under pressure.

You’re commercially curious: digging deeper, spotting patterns, and turning insight into action.

Whatever the task, it’s about doing it well, embracing in-role development, and learning from the people you work alongside.


Why is this role different?

Here you’ll actually see the impact of your work; no endless layers, no waiting for sign-offs. Just real problems, solved fast, with results you can point to."
